Online Job Management Portal
This project is a Java-based Job Management System where customers and workers can submit their details, and an admin manages job assignments. 
The admin dashboard displays all assigned and unassigned jobs, with a drag-and-drop interface for assigning tasks. The entire application is
fully coded in Java (Swing GUI) using Notepad++, and executed through CMD. It provides an efficient workflow for managing job requests, worker
allocation, and job status tracking in real time
