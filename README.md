# Online Job Management Portal

## Project Overview
The Online Job Management Portal is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage jobs, workers, and customer requests efficiently. Customers can submit job requests with their details, while workers register with their skills and availability. The admin dashboard shows all jobs, both assigned and unassigned, with a drag-and-drop interface for easy task allocation. The system tracks job status in real time, allowing workers to update progress and customers to monitor their requests.

The project is fully coded in Java using Swing GUI. Notepad++ is used as the code editor, and the application is compiled and executed through CMD. The modular code structure ensures maintainability, scalability, and reliability. This project demonstrates practical use of Java Swing for creating a user-friendly, desktop-based workflow management system. It simplifies job assignment, reduces manual work, and provides transparency, making it suitable for service-based businesses or small to medium enterprises.
